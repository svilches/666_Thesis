abstract = {The aim of this work was to evaluate the biochemical foundation and clinical merit of multimodal image-guided Raman endoscopy technique for real-time in vivo diagnosis of cancer in the esophagus during clinical endoscopic examinations. A novel fiber-optic Raman endoscopy system was utilized for in vivo esophageal Raman measurements at 785 nm laser excitation within 0.5 second under the multimodal wide-field endoscopic imaging (white light reflectance (WLR) imaging, narrow-band imaging (NBI) and autofluorescence imaging (AFI) guidance. A total of 75 esophageal tissue sites from 27 patients were measured, in which 42 in vivo Raman spectra were from normal tissues and 33 in vivo Raman spectra were from malignant tumors as confirmed by histopathology. The biomolecular modeling (non-negativity-constrained least-squares minimization (NNCLSM) utilizing six basis reference spectra from the representative biochemicals (i.e., actin, collagen, DNA, histones, triolein and glycogen) were employed to estimate the biochemical compositions of esophageal tissue. The resulting diagnostically significant fit coefficients were further utilized through linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and leave-one tissue site-out, cross validation method to develop diagnostic algorithms for esophageal cancer diagnosis. High-quality in vivo Raman spectra in the range of 800-1800 cm-1 can be acquired from normal and cancerous esophageal mucosa in real-time under multimodal endoscopic imaging guidance. Esophageal cancer tissue showed distinct Raman signals mainly associated with cell proliferation, lipid reduction, abnormal nuclear activity and neovasculation. The fit coefficients for actin, DNA, histones, triolein, and glycogen were found to be most significant for construction of the LDA diagnostic model, giving rise to an accuracy of 96.0{\%} (i.e., sensitivity of 97.0{\%} and specificity of 95.2{\%}) for in vivo diagnosis of esophageal cancer. This study demonstrates that multimodal image-guided Raman endoscopy technique in conjunction with biomolecular modeling has promising potential for the real-time, in vivo diagnosis and detection of esophageal cancer during clinical endoscopic examination.},

abstract = {We present a novel bimodal endoscopic imaging probe that can simultaneously provide full-field white-light video microscopy and confocal optical coherence tomography (OCT) depth scans. The two modalities rely on spectrally separated optical paths that run partially in parallel through a micro-optical bench system, which has a cross-section of only 2 mm×2.76 mm and is realized via standard silicon micromachining techniques. With a numerical aperture of 0.061, the video modality has a resolution and field of view of 9.3 and 1240 $\mu$m×1080 $\mu$m, respectively. The resolution is limited by the pixel spacing of the coherent fiber bundle, which relays the acquired image from the distal to the proximal end. A custom-designed diffractive optical element placed within the video imaging path significantly improves the image contrast by up to 45{\%} in the medium frequency range. The OCT modality is optimized for 830 nm center wavelength, and works in a confocal arrangement with an NA of 0.018. It provides single-point depth probing at the center of the video image with a lateral resolution of 20 $\mu$m. Through its compact footprint and enhanced functionality, the probe can provide depth-resolved guiding capability for existing laparoscopes and represents a major step toward a new class of multimodal endoscopic imaging probes.},

The pOCTA system employs an akinetic, all-semiconductor, highly phase-stable swept laser source which operates at 1340 nm central wavelength, with 37 nm bandwidth (at 0 dB region) and 200 kHz A-scan rate. The phase sensitive detection does not need any external phase stabilizing implementations, due to the outstanding high phase linearity and sweep phase repeatability within 2 mrad. We compare the performance of phase based OCTA to speckle based OCTA for visualizing human vascular networks. pOCTA shows better contrast especially for deeper vascular details as compared to speckle based OCTA. The phase stability of the akinetic source allows the OCTA system to show decent vascular contrast only with 2 B-scans. We compare the performance of using 2 versus 4 B-scans for calculating the vascular contrast. Finally, the performance of a 100 nm bandwidth akinetic laser at 1310 nm is investigated for both OCT and OCTA.},

It is demonstrated that EOCT can serve for several clinical purposes such as performing directed biopsy, monitoring functional states of human body, guiding surgical and other treatments and monitoring post-operative recovery processes. We show that applications of OCT are more informative in the case of internal organs covered by epithelium separated from underlying stroma by a smooth basal membrane and therefore concentrate on the results of the EOCT study of three internal organs, namely of larynx, bladder, and uterine cervix.

abstract = {Objective: The purpose of this paper is to estimate the number of patients resulting from the aging of the population for selected diseases (colon cancer, myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus and dementia) in 2012 and 2020 compared to 2002 based on the Federal State of Mecklenburg-West Pomerania as a model for Germany. Data sources: The population projection considers fertility, migration and age-specific mortality in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania. The calculation of patient number is based on age-specific incidence or prevalence from population-based epidemiological studies and/or registers. Study design: The population for 2012 and 2020 is projected for 1-year gender-specific age-cohorts. The demographic projection is then used for the estimation of age- and gender-specific numbers of patients. Results: While the total population will decrease by 10.5{\%} in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania by 2012, both the proportion and the absolute number of people older than 64 years will increase (2002: 294,000; 2012: 349,000; 2020: 382,000). Asa consequence, the incident number of patients with colon cancer will increase by 24.4{\%} by 2012 (+30.9{\%} in 2020) and with myocardial infarction by 27.5{\%} by 2012 (+40.9{\%} in 2020). Conclusion: The demographic change will lead to an absolute increase of patients with colon cancer, myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus and dementia. At the same time the age-spectrum of patients with these diseases will shift towards older ages. (copyright) 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

Methods—Nine subjects with visual complaints following cgBOT were examined between 1 month post-trauma and 6 years post-trauma. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) was used to assess outer retinal architecture, while adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO) was used to analyze photoreceptor mosaic integrity. Results—Visual deficits ranged from central scotomas to decreased visual acuity. SD-OCT defects included focal foveal photoreceptor lesions, variable attenuation of the interdigitation zone, and mottling of the outer segment band, with one subject having normal outer retinal structure. AOSLO revealed disruption of the photoreceptor mosaic in all subjects, variably manifesting as foveal focal discontinuities, perifoveal hyporeflective cones, and paracentral regions of selective cone loss. Conclusions—We observe persistent outer retinal disruption in subjects with visual complaints following cgBOT, albeit to a variable degree. AOSLO imaging allows assessment of photoreceptor structure at a level of detail not resolvable using SD-OCT or other current clinical imaging tools. Multimodal imaging appears useful for revealing the cause of visual complaints in},

Tomographic imaging is demonstrated in vitro in the peripapillary area of the retina and in the coronary artery, two clinically relevant examples that are representative of transparent and turbid media, respectively. Tomographic imaging techniques such as x-ray computed tomography (1), magnetic resonance imaging (2), and ultrasound imaging (3) have found widespread applications in medicine.

Systematic analyses indicated the resonant scanning frequency can be tuned over two orders of magnitude spanning from approximately 10Hz to approximately kHz. Such a flexible scanning frequency range makes it possible to set an appropriate scanning speed of the endoscope to match the different A-scan rates of a variety of FD-OCT systems.

This high resolution, non-invasive imaging technology provides the ability to microscopically evaluate cellular and sub-cellular features in tissue in vivo by optical sectioning. Because many cancers originate in epithelial tissues accessible by endoscopes, confocal endomicroscopy has been explored to detect regions of possible neoplasia at an earlier stage by imaging morphological features in vivo that are significant in histopathologic evaluation. This technique allows real-time assessment of tissue which may improve diagnostic yield by guiding biopsy. Research and development continues to reduce the overall size of the imaging probe, increase the image acquisition speed, and improve resolution and field of view of confocal endomicroscopes. Technical advances will continue to enable application to less accessible organs and more complex systems in the body. Lateral and axial resolutions down to 0.5 and 3 $\mu$m, respectively, field of view as large as 800 × 450 $\mu$m, and objective lens and total probe outer diameters down to 0.35 and 1.25 mm, respectively, have been achieved.

The MEMS mirror is actuated by an electrothermal actuator that is capable of scanning ± 16° at only 3.6 V DC. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional OCT images of microspheres embedded in PDMS and acute rat brain tissue have been obtained with this miniature probe in a time-domain OCT system.},

abstract = {To the best of our knowledge, we present the first needle probe for combined optical coherence tomography (OCT), and fluorescence imaging. The probe uses double-clad fiber (DCF) that guides the OCT signal and fluorescence excitation light in the core and collects and guides the returning fluorescence in the large-diameter multimode inner cladding. It is interfaced to a 1310 nm swept-source OCT system that has been modified to enable simultaneous 488 nm fluorescence excitation and {\textgreater}500 nm emission detection by using a DCF coupler to extract the returning fluorescence signal in the inner cladding with high efficiency. We present imaging results from an excised sheep lung with fluorescein solution infused through the vasculature. We were able to identify alveoli, bronchioles, and blood vessels. The results demonstrate that the combined OCT plus fluorescence needle images provide improved tissue differentiation over OCT alone.},

Our design is the fastest volumetric-scanning, forward-viewing catheterscope for OCT, and the scanning package has the smallest OD of any such OCT package published to date. Using a proof-of-operation catheterscope with commercial lenses, we demonstrate high-quality in vivo and ex vivo volumetric imaging and extend the 1.1 mm diameter field of view more than 200-fold by mo- saicking. Due to its small OD, short rigid tip length, and fast scan rate, this scope is the leading candidate design to enable early detection and staging of bladder cancer during flexible white light cystoscopy. {\textcopyright}},

abstract = {A forward-view optical coherence tomography (OCT) scanning catheter has been developed based on a fiber-cantilever piezotube scanner by using a semi-resonant scan strategy for a better scan performance. A compact endoscope catheter was fabricated by using a tubular piezoelectric actuator with quartered electrodes in combination with a resonant fiber cantilever. A cantilever weight was attached to the fiber cantilever to reduce the resonance frequency down to 63 Hz, well in the desirable range for Fourier-domain OCT. The resonant-cantilever scanner was driven at semi-resonance frequencies that were well out of the resonance peak but within a range of partial resonance. This driving strategy has been found to minimize the phase difference between the two scan axes for a better scan stability against environmental perturbations as well as for a driving simplicity. By driving the two axes at slightly different frequencies, a low-order Lissajous pattern has been obtained for a 2D area scan. 3D OCT images have been successfully acquired in an acquisition time of 1.56 seconds for a tomogram volume of 2.2 × 2.2 × 2.1 mm(3). They were reconstructed without any scan calibration by extracting the scan timing from the image data. In addition, it has been found that the Lissajous scan strategy provides a means to compensate the relative axial motion of a sample for a correct imaged morphology.},

abstract = {A flexible curled optical cord is useful for a common-path optical coherence tomography (OCT) system because a bending-insensitive arbitrary length can be chosen for the endoscopic imaging probe. However, there has been a critical problem that the partial reflector needs to be placed in between the sample and the objective lens. It limits the structure design of optical probe and leads to a low transverse resolution OCT imaging. Instead of a conventional single common-path interferometer, we propose a novel double common-path interferometer configuration in order to generate an interference signal that is independent of the optical distance between the partial reflector and sample. Due to the limitless tuning of the objective distance, an objective lens with a high numerical aperture (NA) up to 0.85 can be successfully used for phase-sensitive optical coherence tomography to achieve a 3-dimensional profile image of a transverse resolution of 0.7 $\mu$m. The intensity and phase terms of the interference signal can be obtained simultaneously from a Fourier-domain mode locked swept laser source for fast data acquisition with a phase stability of 979 pm.},

abstract = {This paper describes a new tripolar spiral cuff electrode, composed of a thin (10 $\mu$m) and flexible polyimide insulating carrier and three circumneural platinum electrodes, suitable for stimulation of peripheral nerves. The cuffs were implanted around the sciatic nerve of two groups of ten rats each, one in which the polyimide ribbon was attached to a plastic connector to characterize the in vivo stimulating properties of the electrode, and one without a connector for testing possible mechanical nerve damage by means of functional and histological methods. The polyimide cuff electrodes induced only a very mild foreign body reaction and did not change the nerve shape over a 2-6 month implantation period. There were no changes in the motor and sensory nerve conduction tests, nociceptive responses and walking track pattern over follow-up, and no morphological evidence of axonal loss or demyelination, except in one case with partial demyelination of some large fibers after 6 months. By delivering single electrical pulses through the cuff electrodes graded recruitment curves of $\alpha$-motor nerve fibers were obtained. Recruitment of all motor units was achieved with a mean charge density lower than 4 $\mu$C/cm2 for a pulse width of 50 $\mu$s at the time of implantation as well as 45 days thereafter. These data indicate that the polyimide cuff electrode is a stable stimulating device, with physical properties and dimensions that avoid nerve compression or activity-induced axonal damage.

abstract = {Minimally invasive medical procedures will benefit from flexible endoscopes that are extremely thin yet produce high quality images. Current devices use fiber bundles or silicon image sensors placed in the distal tip where each pixel in the image is derived from an element in the distal tip, such that improving resolution requires increasing distal tip diameter. The University of Washington has developed the scanning fiber endoscope (SFE) to provide full color, high resolution images from a flexible endoscope with a small distal tip diameter. The SFE uses a single mode fiber vibrating in resonance to scan a focused laser spot over the tissue and a detector to record the time-multiplexed backscatter signal. The SFE contains a 400 micron diameter piezoelectric tube through which a length of singlemode optical fiber is placed. The tube drives the fiber tip at its resonant frequency (currently 5 KHz) in an expanding pattern of 250 spirals (500 pixel diameter image) at a frame rate of 15 Hertz. Imaging parameters are determined by the lens system placed in the 1.06 mm diameter distal tip. Prototype systems with 70 degree field-of-view and 10 micron resolution have been developed. Color images are created with red, green, and blue laser sources coupled into the single scanning fiber. Backscattered light is collected with twelve 250 micron multimode fibers placed around the periphery of the microscanner resulting in a total distal tip diameter of 1.6 mm. Frame sequential color, fluorescence, and continuous color imaging modes have been demonstrated in the non-confocal geometry.},

OCT has been used to detect various cancers including those in gastrointestinal tracts, bladder, and respiratory pathways. For in vivo imaging in visceral organs, small size and fast speed are essential, which can be achieved by using MEMS (Microelectromechanical systems) technology. In this paper, design and experimental results of a miniature endoscopic OCT imaging probe based on unique single-crystal silicon (SCS) MEMS micromirrors are reported. Several generations of one-dimensional (1D) micromirrors with a size of 1 mm by 1 mm have been fabricated. The resonant frequencies and radii of curvature of the micromirrors are about 0.5 kHz and 0.25 m, respectively. The packaged MEMS-OCT probe is 5 mm in diameter. About 15-$\mu$m axial resolutions, 20-$\mu$m transverse resolutions and 5-frames/s image rates are obtained.},

In contrast, RBCs containing no SNO-Hb produced small contractions (less than those of cell-free Hb) that were potentiated by hypoxia (13 Ϯ 2.0{\%} in 95{\%} O 2 versus 25 Ϯ 5{\%} in Ͻ1{\%} O 2 ; P Ͻ 0.05). 10. Protein modeling was done with SYBYL software from TRIPOS Inc. (St. Louis, MO). Hemoglobin coordinates came from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (PDB): In oxy Hb, 1HCO and other PDB coordinate files; in deoxy Hb, 3HHB and other PDB files. NO was modeled onto oxy Hb and deoxy Hb with the use of the bond distanc-es and angles recorded in S. Oae and K. Shinhama [Org. Prep. Proc. Int. 15, 165 (1983)] with rotational freedom about the C␣–C␤, C␤, C␤–S␥, S␥–N␦ bonds. Figures were prepared with the program VIEW (L. Berg-man, University of North Carolina). 11. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats (290 to 350 g) were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital, intubated, and ventilated with a respirator to maintain the ar-terial CO 2 pressure at 35 to 45 mmHg. Drugs were infused through the femoral vein, and blood pres-sure was monitored via the femoral artery as de-scribed in (5). Blood gas tensions and pH were measured periodically; the blood was replaced with three volumes of 0.9{\%} saline. The tissue PO 2 was measured with platinum microelectrodes (50 ␮m outer diameter, coated with Nafion) implanted stereotaxically in the right and left hippocampus (AP, Ϫ3.4 mm; ML, ϩ2.2 mm), caudate putamen nucleus (CPN), and substantia nigra (SN) (see co-ordinates below) as described in C. A. Piantadosi et al., Free Rad. Biol. Med. 22, 725 (1997). The PO 2 electrodes were polarized to Ϫ0.65 V against an Ag/AgCl reference, and the current was measured with a low-impedance nanoampere meter. Arterial PO 2 was adjusted by changing the inspired O 2 concentration and atmospheric pressure. Hydro-gen (H 2)-sensitive platinum microelectrodes were implanted stereotaxically in the SN (AP, Ϫ5.3 mm; ML, Ϫ2.4 mm to the bregma, depth 3.2 mm), CPN (AP, ϩ0.8 mm; ML, Ϫ2.5 mm, depth 5.2 mm), and parietal cortex, for measurement of regional blood flow. The microelectrodes were insulated with ep-oxy, with the exception of the Nafion-coated tip (1 mm). The electrodes were polarized to 400 mV against a reference electrode, and the current was measured with a low-impedance nanoampere meter during and after the inhalation of hydrogen gas (2.5{\%}) for 1 min. The H 2 -clearance curves and O 2 tracings were recorded with PC WINDAQ (soft-ware, DI-200 AC; DATA Q Instruments, OH). Cere-bral blood flow was calculated with the initial slope method [ W. D. Heiss and H. Traupe, Stroke 12, 161 (1981); W. Young, ibid. 11, 552 (1980)]. Re-gional blood flow was monitored for 30 min before and after drug administration (time 0). 12. P. M. Tibbles and J. S.
