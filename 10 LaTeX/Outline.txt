Introduction --------------------------------------------------------
	
	Motivation 
		Why is optical biopsy important? -> OCT
		Thesis = component of miniaturized multimodal probe (list modes)
		No CFB
		Different NAs
		Size matters
		Multimodal: split or coaxial paths
		Aim in 2 lines: simultaneous full field white light microscopy and 3D OCT.

	State of the Art 
		Marc, Simon: HYAZINT [static OCT, picture + schematic, explained in caption]
		Seibel: High freq scanner
		OCT Scanners (needle in tip)
	
	Approach of this thesis (What, not How!)
		Text description of scanner and advantages (sales pitch) with achievements
		[Photo of probe]
		[OCT sample]
	

Theory --------------------------------------------------------------
	
	Optics
		OCT Text, diagrams, spectrum (-> Sklarenko)
		Resolution of confocal Fiber Scanner
		MTF measurement (Ch 4 MTF)

	Mechanics - Piezo tube fiber scanners
		Resonant Beam
		Piezoelectric Tube Actuator (-> Meinert)
			Driving http://www.piezodrive.com/product-tubes.html
			[cross section]

Design & Simulation  ------------------------------------------------
	
	Design Requirements (Bullet List)
		Scanner for bimodal bench -> Sets size constraints -> piezo fiber scanner
		No parallax: Coaxial with beamsplitter
		Desired resolution and DOF (Standard in field)

	Design Overview: Resonant fiber scanner. 
		[First cross section of probe]
		Why constraints lead to fiber scanner
			- Small diameter
			- FOV > scanning diameter
		But: tradeoffs need to be made: analysis and simulation

	Optical Design
		Fourier plane scanner
		Selection of components
		Minimization of backreflections
		ZEMAX simulation

	Mechanical Design
		Analytical calculations (res freq, bending line, max radius)

		Spiral scanning

	Overview of design
