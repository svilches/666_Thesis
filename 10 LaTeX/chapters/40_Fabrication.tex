\chapter{Implementation}
\label{Ch:Fab}	

This chapter details the implementation of the probe shown in \autoref{fig:overview}, which serves as a demonstrator of the fiber scanner design and evaluation tool of the optical performance of the OCT beam path.

      \label{fig:overview}
\end{figure}

The design can be summarized as follows: The piezoelectric actuator has four outer gold electrodes to control the lateral movement of the scanner. The addressing of these electrodes is realized by a ribbon cable, which is wrapped around the piezoelectric tube. The single mode fiber is centered in the piezoelectric tube and the GRIN lens bonded to the tip of this fiber. This arrangement enables a compact fiber scanner with a total length of \SI{9}{\milli\meter} and a resonance frequency of \SI{750}{\hertz} optimized for an OCT system with an A-Scan repetition rate of \SI{100}{\kilo\hertz}.

The following paragraphs describe the manufacturing process and assembly of the most relevant components of the probe, beginning with the fabrication of the polyimide electrodes used for contacting the piezoelectric tube and proceeding with details of the necessary assembly steps to fabricate the scanner, leading to the assembly of the complete probe.


%%*****************************************************************************
\section{Polyimide Electrodes}
%%*****************************************************************************
The first challenge that appears in the manufacturing of the scanner lies in contacting the four external electrodes of the piezoelectric tube. 

Due to the small diameter of the tube (\SI{800}{\micro\meter}), creating a reliable interface between the driving circuit and its electrodes is not trivial. Other piezoscanner implementations use soft soldering and insulated copper wires \cite{Lee2010}, \cite{Meinert}, \cite{Huo2010}, but the soldering process can damage the piezoelectric material, as it is exposed to temperatures above its Curie temperature. This method also increases the diameter of the actuator significantly, as a solder blob is needed. %Furthermore, it requires welding by hand in a \SI{600}{\micro\meter} curved electrode.

Instead, this design uses a polyimide ribbon cable which is wrapped around the piezotube and addresses its four external electrodes using vias. Its geometry, cross section and application over the tube is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:piRolled}, while \autoref{fig:piRender} shows its complete design.

      \label{fig:piRolled}
\end{figure}

It is manufactured using a cleanroom process similar to the one used for cuff electrodes for nerve stimulation \cite{Rodriguez2000} and consists of platinum tracks and via holes embedded in a polyimide substrate. One end the cable is shaped to fit a zero insertion force (ZIF) connector. The other end can be rolled around the piezoelectric tube, allowing the bonding to its gold electrodes using conductive glue (Araldite 2020 with 80\% wt. silver particles).

      \label{fig:piRender}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Cleanroom processing}
The polyimide ribbon cables are manufactured and singulated at wafer level. The process involves spin coating a \SI{5}{\micro\meter} layer of polyimide, over which \SI{100}{\nano\meter} of platinum is sputtered and then patterned by liftoff, defining the conductive traces. On top of it, a second \SI{5}{\micro\meter} layer is spincoated. Finally, the vias, openings and external shape are patterned through reactive ion etching (RIE). This process is described in Figure \ref{fig:piProcess} and the resultant wafer in \autoref{fig:piwafer}.

\section{Fiber-GRIN Bonding}
\label{sec:fiberGRIN}
%%*****************************************************************************
Another step that has to be performed before the final assembly of the probe is to bond the GRIN lens to the end of the fiber optically and mechanically. This interface is critical: first, because it is subjected to very high forces due to the oscillation of the scanner, and second, because any angular or displacement error would degrade the optical quality.

To overcome these challenges, fiber and GRIN lens are aligned together using a custom made, KOH-etched silicon alignment tool. The geometry of the KOH-etched grooves together with the cylindrical shape of both components allow the precise angle and position control of the fiber and GRIN lens. Once in place, a drop of index-matched UV-curable glue (NOA 76) bonds the components together. The wetting behavior and surface tension of the glue create a symmetrical wedge which provides extra mechanical integrity, as can be seen in \autoref{fig:fiberGRINglue}.

\section{3D Printed Housing}
%%*****************************************************************************

The bimodal probe is designed to be assembled using the silicon bench technology \cite{Kretschmer}. But for the demonstrator, a process with reduced complexity, which allows faster design adjustments has been tested: using a 3D printed polymer structure for both assembly and housing.

This is possible because, even though the dimensional accuracy of the printed housing is lower than its silicon counterpart, the optical components of the demonstrator allow relatively high placement tolerances, as the beam is collimated in the region between GRIN lens and objective lens. This way, simple alignment structures which are 3D-printed within the housing allow the proper placement of all components, as shown in \autoref{fig:housing}. The main dimensions of the housing are depicted in \autoref{fig:housingDim}.

\begin{figure}[h!]\centering \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/40_Fabrication/Housing/housing.pdf}
      \caption{CAD (a) and photography (b) of the single modality probe with alignment features.}
      \label{fig:housing}
\end{figure}

      \caption{Top view of the single modality probe showing the main dimensions of the housing.}
      \label{fig:housingDim}
\end{figure}

The housing is manufactured using a \textit{B9Creator} stereolithography printer, which allows the polimerization of an acrylic resin with a lateral resolution of \SI{30}{\micro\meter}.


%As an example, in order to center the piezotube in the housing, first the fiber is retracted so that the GRIN lens seats in the GRIN alignment structure (Figure \ref{fig:grinAlignment} left). This way the piezotube is aligned in the housing and, after being glued in place, it is possible to push the fiber so that the GRIN is at its proper distance (Figure \ref{fig:grinAlignment} right).

%%*****************************************************************************
\section{Assembly}
%%*****************************************************************************

%\autoref{fig:exploded} shows the components upon which the demonstrator probe is built and the resultant assembly.

%      \textbf{b)} Photograph of the assembled probe with the top half of the housing removed.}
%      \label{fig:exploded}
%\end{figure}


Once all the components are ready, the assembly is performed by hand using the multiple alignment features of the housing. The exploded view in \autoref{fig:exploded} shows the placement of the components prior to assembly, followed by the final encapsulation. This process is summarized as follows:

      \label{fig:exploded}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The GRIN lens is bonded to the end of the fiber using the alignment tool (\autoref{sec:fiberGRIN}).
\item The GRIN-fiber assembly is slid through the piezotube and centered with FR-2 fittings, which are glued to the piezotube using cyanocrilate.
\item The piezotube-fiber-GRIN assembly is placed in the housing and glued in place using cyanocrilate with help of the alignment structures.
\item The planoconvex lens is placed in the bottom half of the housing and glued using UV-curable optical glue.
\item The probe is closed with the top half of the housing and sealed with UV-curable glue.
\end{enumerate}
