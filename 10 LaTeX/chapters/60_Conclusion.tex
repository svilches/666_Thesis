The main goal of this work was the realization of a ...

\paragraph{Design}
The principal idea presented here is to use a black aqueous pigment dispersion for closing an aperture stop, whereas silicone oil is used as a transparent index matching liquid. The working principle is based on capillary forces, which avoids the use of channels and 

\paragraph{Characterization}
After fabrication, the aperture stops have been characterized considering the attenuation as well as the transmission and the actuation performance....


\paragraph{Outlook}
The presented optofluidic micro-iris is a low priced, compact concept, which provides several possibilities for improvement...
